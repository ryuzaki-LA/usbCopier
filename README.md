# usbCopier
The USB Copier is a script that allows you to immediately copy all files from a USB drive to a specific folder as soon as the USB is plugged in. This tool is particularly useful for red teaming purposes.

To run the script, the user should open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
They can then execute the script using the command "python usbCopier2.py -u <usb_path> -o <output_folder>".
 The user should replace <usb_path> with the path to their USB drive and <output_folder> with the path to the destination folder where they want the files to be copied.
